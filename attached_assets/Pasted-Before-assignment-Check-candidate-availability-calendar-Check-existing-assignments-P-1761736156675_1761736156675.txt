Before assignment:
  → Check candidate availability calendar
  → Check existing assignments
  → Prevent double-booking
  → Require candidate confirmation
```

### **2. Incomplete Edge Cases**

#### **Scenario 1: Multiple Business Users Compete for Same Candidate**
```
Current behavior: UNDEFINED
Questions:
- First-come-first-serve?
- Auction/bidding system?
- Candidate chooses?

Recommended: Priority scoring
  → Fit score (40%) 
  → Project budget (30%)
  → Candidate preference (30%)
```

#### **Scenario 2: Candidate Rejects Assignment After Backup Activated**
```
Current behavior: UNDEFINED
Questions:
- What happens to primary candidate?
- Can primary be re-assigned?
- How to handle duplicate assignments?

Recommended: State machine
  pending → offered → accepted → active → completed
  Each state has clear transition rules
```

#### **Scenario 3: Jira Sync Fails or Data Inconsistent**
```
Current behavior: Likely crashes
Questions:
- What if Jira returns 500 error?
- What if milestone not found in Jira?
- How to handle manual Jira edits?

Recommended: Sync status tracking
  → Last sync timestamp
  → Sync error log
  → Manual override option for business user
```

### **3. Business Logic Gaps**

#### **Gap 1: Payment/Pricing Model Missing**
```
Questions:
- How are candidates paid?
- How are business users charged?
- Commission structure?

Need to define:
  → Pricing model (subscription? per-hire? commission?)
  → Payment workflows
  → Invoice generation
  → Escrow for milestone-based payments?
```

#### **Gap 2: Candidate Evaluation After Assignment**
```
Current: No feedback loop
Questions:
- How to evaluate candidate performance?
- Impact on future fit scores?
- Rating system?

Recommended: Post-project review
  → Business rates candidate (1-5 stars)
  → Affects future fit score weighting
  → Builds candidate reputation score
```

#### **Gap 3: Project Cancellation Policy**
```
Current: UNDEFINED
Questions:
- What if business cancels project mid-way?
- Compensation for candidates?
- Penalty for business user?

Recommended: Cancellation rules
  → Before assignment: Full refund
  → After assignment but <7 days: 50% compensation to candidate
  → After 7 days: Full payment to candidate + penalty to business
```

## 🔄 **Workflow Improvements Needed**

### **Improvement 1: Add Confirmation Steps**

**Current**:
```
Create project → Auto-generate skill maps → Auto-calculate fit scores
```

**Recommended**:
```
Create project 
→ AI suggests skill map 
→ Business reviews/edits ✅ (human-in-the-loop)
→ Confirm skill map
→ Calculate fit scores
→ Business reviews top 10 candidates
→ Select candidates to notify ✅
```

**Why**: Business might want to adjust AI suggestions, prevent irrelevant notifications

---

### **Improvement 2: Candidate Application Workflow**

**Current**:
```
Candidate sees project (>70% fit) → Can view details
Status: "pending" forever?
```

**Recommended**:
```
Candidate views project
→ "Save" (bookmark) or "Apply" (express interest)
→ If "Apply":
   → Business notified
   → Candidate status: "applied"
   → Business reviews → "interview" → "accept/reject"
→ If "Save":
   → No notification
   → Candidate can apply later
```

**Why**: Clear distinction between browsing vs serious interest

---

### **Improvement 3: Risk Alert Escalation**

**Current**:
```
High risk → Auto-activate backup
```

**Recommended**:
```
Delay detected (>20%)
→ Low risk: Monitor only, notify business
→ Medium risk: Notify business + prepare backup list
→ High risk: Notify business + backup, require decision in 24h
→ Critical risk (>40% delay): Auto-activate backup + escalate to management
```

**Why**: Different risk levels need different responses, not all need immediate backup

## 📊 **Business Metrics Missing**

### **Need to Track**:
```
1. Time-to-Fill Metrics
   - Avg time: Project created → Candidate assigned
   - Target: <48 hours for high-fit matches

2. Candidate Utilization Rate
   - % of time candidates are assigned vs available
   - Target: 60-80% (avoid burnout)

3. Fit Score Accuracy
   - Business rating after project vs predicted fit score
   - Adjust AI model if correlation <0.7

4. Backup Activation Success Rate
   - % of backup activations that prevented project delay
   - If <50%, reconsider activation threshold

5. Churn Metrics
   - Candidate drop-off rate after signup
   - Business user retention after first project
